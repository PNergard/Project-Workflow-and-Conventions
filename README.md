##Git Workflow and branching

###Master
This is the main repository used for deploying releases. No development is done here but rather branched to **develop** or **hotfix** to later be merged back into the master branch when ready for a release. The master holds all release tags, and tags are made using [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org).

####Common conventions:
- **Naming convention:** Refer to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org)

###Hotfix
Hotfix branches are used to quickly patch production releases. This is the only branch that should fork directly off of master. As soon as the fix is complete, it should be merged into both master and develop (or the current release branch), and master should be tagged with an updated version number.

####Common conventions:
- **Naming convention:** hotfix-* or hotfix/*
- **branch off:** master
- **merge into:** master/develop/release
